- [ ] What are Max and Min point values in JSPAM code?

# Need to do
- [X] Grab human_rated scores from SDSS file and save somewhere.
- [ ] Compare and constrast machine created scores with human scores **JACKSON**
- [ ] Create target images for multiple SDSS **(IN PROGRESS)**
- [X] Target image info.txt file containing pixel points for centers of galaxies **JACKSON**

# WANT to do
- [ ] Develop new methods for comparing images
- [ ] Get JSPAM python script running on Herschel
- [ ] Save point files in binary format
- [X] create info.txt along with point files with useful info **I THINK?**
- [ ] Develop script running entire process.  JSPAM -> Image Creation -> Rate
- [ ] Evolve variables
- [ ] Account for background noise in target image in absolute difference comparison code.
- [ ] Optimize parallel processing in image creation code
- [ ] Find optimal parameters in image creation code

# Thesis
- [ ] Write Methods section
