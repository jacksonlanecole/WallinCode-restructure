What to do next
- Start creating different SDSS run folders
- Optimize Non-Par
    - if ( numDots < numPoints) always!
        - Add brightness dot first.  normalize/gaus blur.  Do gaussian blur for non-zero pixels. Consider
- optimize Par
    - For loop standard:  Looks like the most effecient.
- Somehow make the outer portions of gal have a higher score.
    - Use seperate img to fade out center
    - combine img & diff code and weight outer portions more heavily.

Want to do
- Develop new methods for comparing images
- Save point files in binary format
- Develope script running entire process.  JSPAM -> Image Creation -> Rate
- Evolve variables

Thesis
- galaxy brightness profile
- variation of brightness
